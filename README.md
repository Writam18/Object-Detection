Autonomous Driving Application Car detection implements YOLO V3 algorithhm and detects objects in a given image by predicting boundary boxes and probabibility.

Object Detection with ImageAI does the same thing of object detection but with the ImageAI library...We can use Retinanet,YOLO,Tiny YOLO through ImageAI.
